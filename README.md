# Toggle Ethernet

**Usage**

_You need to run this as administrator, or it won't work! To do so, right click the .exe and click "Run as administrator"._

_You can also make a shortcut that alsways runs with admin privileges. Right click, properties, advanced, run as administrator._

***

Use the key combination **WINKEY + A** to toggle your ethernet connection.

I included the .ahk script, but you don't need to use that unless you want to make changes or something.

If you just want to use it, double-click the .exe and you're set! No need to install AutoHotKey.
